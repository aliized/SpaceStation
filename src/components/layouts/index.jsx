      first new folder is the layouts folder and this one is really simple. This
      is just a special folder for placing any layout based components. This
      would be things like a sidebar, navbar, container, etc. If you application
      only has a handful of layouts then this folder really isn't needed and you
      can just place the layout components in the components folder, but if you
      have multiple different layouts used across your application this is a
      great place to store them.
